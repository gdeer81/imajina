# imajina
#Imajina (ee-mah-hee-na) is an imaginary machine learning library written in Clojure.

"When we stop imagining, we stop learning; but when we stop dreaming, we start doing"

This library attempts to strike a balance between practical and creative thinking in the machine learning space.

Machine learning techniques are grounded in reasoning with logic and statistics. This library will rely heavily on
the statistical side while rethinking logic-based reasoning.

Another intended goal of this library is to be a beginner friendly introduction to machine learning.
Don't use this library if you are tying to predict which hospital patients will have a heart attack.
Do use it if you are trying to figure out if any of the people visiting your website might leave helpful feedback about 
your site.
